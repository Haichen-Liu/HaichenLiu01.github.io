Hello! My name is **Haichen Liu**. I am currently pursuing my Masterâ€™s degree at the [School of Engineering](https://eng.ed.ac.uk/), [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/).  
My primary research interests lie in **digital signal processing, image processing, communication systems, and machine learning**. I am particularly interested in enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of AI algorithms, with applications spanning **object detection and human pose estimation**.

Throughout my academic journey, I have sought to bridge **theoretical knowledge and practical applications**. My work has included object detection models such as [YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics), [DETR](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr), [SSD](https://github.com/amdegroot/ssd.pytorch), and [Faster RCNN](https://github.com/jwyang/faster-rcnn.pytorch), as well as human pose estimation methods like [YOLOPose](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06806), [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose), and [VideoPose3D](https://github.com/facebookresearch/VideoPose3D).

From **2019 to 2025**, I had the privilege of working with [Prof. Jianqiang Mei](https://dianzi.tute.edu.cn/info/1291/25232.htm), [Prof. Chengguang Sun](https://dianzi.tute.edu.cn/info/1291/25232.htm), [Prof. Dan Cheng](https://dianzi.tute.edu.cn/info/1291/25162.htm), and [Prof. Xuewen Ding](https://dianzi.tute.edu.cn/info/1291/25172.htm) related to the **Internet of Things, embedded systems, advanced image processing, and machine learning**.  
Under the guidance of Prof. Mei, I had the opportunity to broaden my expertise in advanced imaging and machine learning techniques, which laid a strong foundation for my later research, and also greatly benefited from inspiring discussions and collaborations with [Prof. Dandan Zheng](https://seea.tju.edu.cn/info/1013/1563.htm), Dr. Maosheng Wang, and Lishui Liang at the [School of Electrical Automation and Information Engineering](https://seea.tju.edu.cn/index.htm), [Tianjin University](https://www.tju.edu.cn/). These experiences further deepened my understanding of related technologies and applications.  

My friend and collaborator **Ye Liu** has also been an important part of my academic journey, providing both intellectual support and encouragement throughout my studies.

Looking ahead, I am excited to continue exploring the intersections of **signal processing, computer vision, machine learning, and communication systems**, and to contribute to research that is both **scientifically impactful and practically meaningful**.

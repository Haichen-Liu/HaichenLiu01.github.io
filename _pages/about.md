Hello! My name is Haichen Liu. I will pursue my Master’s degree at the [School of Engineering](https://eng.ed.ac.uk/), [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). My primary focus is on digital signal processing, image processing, communication systems, and machine learning.

Throughout my academic career, I have been dedicated to applying theoretical knowledge to solve practical problems, with a particular emphasis on enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of AI algorithms. This includes work with object detection models like [YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics), [DETR](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr), [SSD](https://github.com/amdegroot/ssd.pytorch), and [Faster RCNN](https://github.com/jwyang/faster-rcnn.pytorch), as well as human pose estimation techniques such as [YOLOPose](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06806) (which is based on [YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)), [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose), and [VideoPose](https://github.com/facebookresearch/VideoPose3D).

Over the past few years, I have engaged in a variety of projects focusing on image processing, human pose estimation, and embedded systems. These experiences have sharpened my technical expertise while enhancing my skills in teamwork and project management. During my undergraduate studies, I had the privilege of working with [Prof. Jianqiang Mei](https://dianzi.tute.edu.cn/info/1291/25232.htm) on projects related to advanced image processing and machine learning. Through continuous learning, I have mastered advanced technologies and tools, maintaining a keen interest in emerging innovations.

During my undergraduate studies, under the guidance of [Prof. Chenguang Sun](https://dianzi.tute.edu.cn/info/1291/25242.htm), I completed my thesis titled “Design of Intelligent Greenhouse Garden Based on AIoT Technology.” This work earned me the Excellent Graduation Project (Thesis) award, with a grade of 94 points, ranking first in the School of Electronic Engineering in 2023.

I am thrilled to explore the intersection of digital signal processing, image processing, machine learning, and communication systems. I look forward to collaborating with and inspiring others who share my passion for these dynamic fields.

Hello! My name is Haichen Liu. I will pursue my Masterâ€™s degree in Signal Processing and Communications at the [School of Engineering](https://eng.ed.ac.uk/), [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). My primary focus is on digital signal processing, image processing, communication systems, and machine learning.

Throughout my academic career, I have been dedicated to applying theoretical knowledge to solve practical problems, with a particular emphasis on enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of AI algorithms. This includes work with object detection models like [YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics), [DETR](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr), [SSD](https://github.com/amdegroot/ssd.pytorch), and [Faster RCNN](https://github.com/jwyang/faster-rcnn.pytorch), as well as human pose estimation techniques such as [YOLOPose](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06806) (which is based on [YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)), [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose), and [VideoPose](https://github.com/facebookresearch/VideoPose3D).

Over the past few years, I have participated in various projects related to image processing, human pose estimation, and embedded systems. These experiences have not only honed my technical skills but also strengthened my abilities in teamwork and project management. Through continuous learning and exploration, I have mastered numerous advanced technologies and tools, maintaining a high sensitivity and enthusiasm for emerging technologies.

In 2024, under the supervision of Prof. [Jianqiang Mei](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jianqiang-Mei), I contributed to two papers presented at the International Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference (I2MTC): [AuraPose](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10561032) and
[Research and Implementation of Automatic Gain Control Method for Time-Difference Ultrasonic Gas Meter](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10561236), respectively.

In conclusion, I am eager to delve deeper into the intersection of digital signal processing, image processing, machine learning, and related communication systems. I aspire to share my knowledge and experiences with others who are passionate about these fields.

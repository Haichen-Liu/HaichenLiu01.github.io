Hello! My name is Haichen Liu. I will pursue my Master’s degree in [Signal Processing and Communications](https://postgraduate.degrees.ed.ac.uk/?r=site/view&id=20) at the [School of Engineering](https://eng.ed.ac.uk/), [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). My primary focus is on digital signal processing, image processing, communication systems, and machine learning.

Throughout my academic career, I have been dedicated to applying theoretical knowledge to solve practical problems, with a particular emphasis on enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of AI algorithms. This includes work with object detection models like [YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics), [DETR](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr), [SSD](https://github.com/amdegroot/ssd.pytorch), and [Faster RCNN](https://github.com/jwyang/faster-rcnn.pytorch), as well as human pose estimation techniques such as [YOLOPose](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06806) (which is based on [YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)), [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose), and [VideoPose](https://github.com/facebookresearch/VideoPose3D).

Over the past few years, I have participated in various projects related to image processing, human pose estimation, and embedded systems. These experiences have not only honed my technical skills but also strengthened my abilities in teamwork and project management. Through continuous learning and exploration, I have mastered numerous advanced technologies and tools, maintaining a high sensitivity and enthusiasm for emerging technologies.

In 2024, under the supervision of Prof. [Jianqiang Mei](https://dianzi.tute.edu.cn/info/1291/25232.htm), I contributed to two papers presented at the International Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference (I2MTC): [AuraPose](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10561032) and
[Research and Implementation of Automatic Gain Control Method for Time-Difference Ultrasonic Gas Meter](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10561236), respectively.


During my undergraduate years at the School of Electronic Engineering, Tianjin University of Technology and Education, I had the privilege of working under Prof. [Chengguang Sun](https://dianzi.tute.edu.cn/info/1291/25242.htm) and Prof. [Dan Cheng](https://dianzi.tute.edu.cn/info/1291/25162.htm). They guided me and my peers to notable successes in national and regional competitions, including:

November 2023: Second Prize (National Level) in the Circuit Simulation Design Track (Undergraduate Division) at the 2nd National Simulation Innovation Application Competition.
December 2022: Second Prize (National Level) in the Circuit Simulation Design Track (Undergraduate Division) at the 1st National Simulation Innovation Application Competition.
July 2022: Third Prize (Provincial/Ministerial Level) in the North China Division at the 6th National College Student Integrated Circuit Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition.
December 2022: Third Prize (Provincial/Ministerial Level) at the 5th Tianjin University Student Information Technology "New Engineering" Practice Innovation Competition.
December 2021: Third Prize (Provincial/Ministerial Level) at the 4th Tianjin University Student Information Technology "New Engineering" Practice Innovation Competition.

Under Prof. Sun’s supervision, I completed my undergraduate thesis, "Design of Intelligent Greenhouse Garden Based on AIoT Technology", which received the Excellent Graduation Project (Thesis) Award in 2023 at Tianjin University of Technology and Education. Scoring 94 points, it ranked first in the School of Electronic Engineering.

Additionally, under Prof. Dan Cheng, I contributed to a National College Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Project. My work focused on developing the Echarts Human Physical Fitness Data Visualization and Monitoring System and the Smart Home Fitness Monitoring Device, enhancing my expertise in data visualization, embedded systems, and smart technology applications.

In conclusion, I’m excited to explore the convergence of digital signal processing, image processing, machine learning, and communication systems. I hope to collaborate with and inspire others who share my enthusiasm for these fields.

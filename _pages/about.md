Hello! I am currently pursuing my master’s degree at the [School of Engineering](https://eng.ed.ac.uk/), [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), where I’m fortunate to be supervised by Prof. [Sotirios Tsaftaris](https://eng.ed.ac.uk/about/people/professor-sotirios-tsaftaris).  

My primary research interests lie in machine learning, image processing, computer vision, and digital signal processing. I am particularly interested in enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of AI algorithms, with applications spanning object detection and human pose estimation. Throughout my academic journey, I have sought to bridge theoretical knowledge and practical applications. My work has included object detection models such as  [YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics), [DETR](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr), [SSD](https://github.com/amdegroot/ssd.pytorch), and [Faster R-CNN](https://github.com/jwyang/faster-rcnn.pytorch), as well as human pose estimation methods like [YOLOPose](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06806), [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose), and [VideoPose3D](https://github.com/facebookresearch/VideoPose3D).

Before pursuing my master’s studies at the University of Edinburgh, I had the privilege of working with Prof. [Jianqiang Mei](https://dianzi.tute.edu.cn/info/1291/25232.htm), Prof. [Chengguang Sun](https://dianzi.tute.edu.cn/info/1291/25242.htm), Prof. [Dan Cheng](https://dianzi.tute.edu.cn/info/1291/25162.htm), and Prof. [Xuewen Ding](https://dianzi.tute.edu.cn/info/1291/25172.htm)  on topics related to the internet of things, embedded systems, image processing, and machine learning. Under the guidance of Prof. Jianqiang Mei, I broadened my expertise in advanced imaging and machine learning techniques, which laid a strong foundation for my later research. Additionally, my friend and collaborator Ye Liu has been an important part of my academic journey, providing both intellectual support and encouragement throughout my studies.

### 🔍 Current Research

I am currently conducting research on **Visual Anagrams** and **Optical Illusions**, exploring how generative diffusion models can produce multi-view optical illusions and reveal new insights into perceptual ambiguity. This work forms part of my MSc dissertation project, focusing on potential applications in medical image analysis, human visual perception modeling, and AI-based diagnostic image synthesis. The goal is to understand how generative models can represent and reproduce ambiguous visual patterns, providing insights into both human cognition and artificial perception systems.

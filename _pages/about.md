Currently, I am a student pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Signal Processing and Communications at the [School of Engineering](https://eng.ed.ac.uk/), [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). 

My academic journey began at [Tianjin University of Technology and Education](https://www.tute.edu.cn/), where I completed my undergraduate studies majoring in Electronic Information Engineering within the [School of Electronic Engineering](https://dianzi.tute.edu.cn/). During my bachelor's, I focused on digital signal processing, image processing, human pose estimation, and embedded systems.

In 2024, I contributed to two papers presented at the International Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference (I2MTC), under the supervision of Prof. [Jianqiang Mei](https://dianzi.tute.edu.cn/info/1073/4042.htm).

Throughout my academic career, I have been dedicated to applying theoretical knowledge to address practical problems, with a particular emphasis on enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of AI algorithms, including target detection models like YOLO, human pose estimation techniques such as YOLOPose, OpenPose, and VideoPose. Over the past few years, I have participated in various projects related to image processing, human pose estimation, and embedded systems, which have not only honed my technical skills but also strengthened my abilities in teamwork and project management.

By continuously learning and exploring, I have mastered numerous advanced technologies and tools, maintaining a high sensitivity and enthusiasm for emerging technologies. Looking forward, I am eager to delve deeper into digital signal processing and image processing, aspiring to share my knowledge and experiences with others passionate about these fields.

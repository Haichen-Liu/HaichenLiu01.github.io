Hello! My name is Haichen Liu. I am currently pursuing my Master‚Äôs degree at the [School of Engineering](https://eng.ed.ac.uk/), [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), where I‚Äôm fortunate to be supervised by Professor [Sotirios Tsaftaris](https://eng.ed.ac.uk/about/people/professor-sotirios-tsaftaris).  

My primary research interests lie in **machine learning, image processing, computer vision, and digital signal processing**. I am particularly interested in enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of AI algorithms, with applications spanning **object detection** and **human pose estimation**.  
Throughout my academic journey, I have sought to bridge theoretical knowledge and practical applications.  
My work has included object detection models such as [YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics), [DETR](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr), [SSD](https://github.com/amdegroot/ssd.pytorch), and [Faster R-CNN](https://github.com/jwyang/faster-rcnn.pytorch), as well as human pose estimation methods like [YOLOPose](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06806), [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose), and [VideoPose3D](https://github.com/facebookresearch/VideoPose3D).  

From **2019 to 2025**, I had the privilege of working with Prof. [Jianqiang Mei](https://dianzi.tute.edu.cn/info/1291/25232.htm), Prof. [Chengguang Sun](https://dianzi.tute.edu.cn/info/1291/25242.htm), Prof. [Dan Cheng](https://dianzi.tute.edu.cn/info/1291/25162.htm), and Prof. [Xuewen Ding](https://dianzi.tute.edu.cn/info/1291/25172.htm) on topics related to the **Internet of Things**, **embedded systems**, **advanced image processing**, and **machine learning**.  
Under the guidance of Prof. Mei, I broadened my expertise in advanced imaging and machine learning techniques, which laid a strong foundation for my later research.  
Additionally, my friend and collaborator **Ye Liu** has been an important part of my academic journey, providing both intellectual support and encouragement throughout my studies.

### üîç Currently, I am conducting research on **Visual Anagrams** and **Optical Illusions**, exploring how **generative diffusion models** can produce multi-view optical illusions and reveal new insights into perceptual ambiguity. This work forms part of my **MSc dissertation project**, focusing on potential applications in **medical image analysis**, **human visual perception modeling**, and **AI-based diagnostic image synthesis**. The goal is to understand how generative models can represent and reproduce ambiguous visual patterns, providing insights into both **human cognition** and **artificial perception systems**.  

- [**Visual Anagrams**](https://github.com/dangeng/visual_anagrams) ‚Äî studying multi-view optical illusions generated by diffusion models  
- [**GAN**](https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-GAN) ‚Äî exploring generative enhancement for diagnostic and low-light imaging  
- [**Hugging Face Diffusers**](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) ‚Äî implementing diffusion-based synthesis for perceptually consistent visual outputs  


Additionally, **Ye Liu** and I are collaborating on a follow-up to our previous work **DarkYOLO**, exploring new approaches for low-light object detection.

- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**  
  Additionally, I have been learning and exploring topics related to **object detection** and **image generation for low-light image enhancement and style transfer**.  
  - Learning to implement [GAN](https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-GAN) for low-light image enhancement.  

- **Diffusion Models**  
  - Experimenting with [Hugging Face Diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) to understand high-quality image generation under complex visual conditions.  

- **Network Structure Exploration**  
  - Studying [SCINet](https://github.com/cure-lab/SCINet), originally designed for time-series decomposition, and exploring its potential for improving feature extraction and multi-scale representation in image enhancement.

I also enjoy **anime**, which inspires my interest in artistic image generation.  
- Exploring artistic style generation with [AniGAN](https://github.com/bing-li-ai/AniGAN), [AnimeGAN](https://github.com/TachibanaYoshino/AnimeGAN), and [MangaGAN](https://github.com/nikitaa30/Manga-GAN). üé®

Looking ahead, I am excited to continue exploring the intersections of **machine learning, image processing, computer vision, and digital signal processing**, and to contribute to research that is both scientifically impactful and practically meaningful.

Hello! My name is **Haichen Liu**. I am currently pursuing my Master‚Äôs degree at the [School of Engineering](https://eng.ed.ac.uk/), [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/).  

My primary research interests lie in **machine learning, image processing, computer vision, and digital signal processing**. I am particularly interested in enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of AI algorithms, with applications spanning object detection and human pose estimation. Throughout my academic journey, I have sought to bridge theoretical knowledge and practical applications. My work has included object detection models such as [YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics), [DETR](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr), [SSD](https://github.com/amdegroot/ssd.pytorch), and [Faster RCNN](https://github.com/jwyang/faster-rcnn.pytorch), as well as human pose estimation methods like [YOLOPose](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06806), [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose), and [VideoPose3D](https://github.com/facebookresearch/VideoPose3D).

From 2019 to 2025, I had the privilege of working with [Prof. Jianqiang Mei](https://dianzi.tute.edu.cn/info/1291/25232.htm), [Prof. Chengguang Sun](https://dianzi.tute.edu.cn/info/1291/25242.htm), [Prof. Dan Cheng](https://dianzi.tute.edu.cn/info/1291/25162.htm), and [Prof. Xuewen Ding](https://dianzi.tute.edu.cn/info/1291/25172.htm) on topics related to the **Internet of Things, embedded systems, advanced image processing, and machine learning**. Under the guidance of Prof. Mei, I broadened my expertise in advanced imaging and machine learning techniques, which laid a strong foundation for my later research. Additionally, my friend and collaborator **Ye Liu** has been an important part of my academic journey, providing both intellectual support and encouragement throughout my studies.

### üîç Recently, I have been learning and exploring topics related to **object detection** and **image generation for low-light image enhancement and style transfer**.

- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**:  
  - Learning to implement [PyTorch-GAN](https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-GAN) for low-light image enhancement.  
  - Exploring artistic style generation with [AniGAN](https://github.com/bing-li-ai/AniGAN), [AnimeGAN](https://github.com/TachibanaYoshino/AnimeGAN), and [MangaGAN](https://github.com/nikitaa30/Manga-GAN). üé®  

- **Diffusion Models**:  
  - Experimenting with [Hugging Face Diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) to understand high-quality image generation under complex visual conditions.  

- **Network structure exploration**:  
  - Studying [SCINet](https://github.com/cure-lab/SCINet), originally designed for time-series decomposition, and exploring its potential for improving feature extraction and multi-scale representation in image enhancement.

Looking ahead, I am excited to continue exploring the intersections of **machine learning, image processing, computer vision, and digital signal processing**, and to contribute to research that is both scientifically impactful and practically meaningful.

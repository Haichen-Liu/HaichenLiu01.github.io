Hello! I am currently pursuing my master’s degree at the [School of Engineering](https://eng.ed.ac.uk/), [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), where I’m fortunate to be supervised by Prof. [Sotirios A. Tsaftaris](https://eng.ed.ac.uk/about/people/professor-sotirios-tsaftaris), with co-supervision from Dr. [Panos Dimitrakopoulos](https://vios.science/team/panos) and Mr. [Konstantinos Vilouras](https://vios.science/team/kostas).

My primary research interests lie in machine learning, image processing, computer vision, and digital signal processing. I am particularly interested in enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of AI algorithms, with applications spanning object detection and human pose estimation. Throughout my academic journey, I have sought to bridge theoretical knowledge and practical applications. My work has included object detection models such as  [YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics), [DETR](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr), [SSD](https://github.com/amdegroot/ssd.pytorch), and [Faster R-CNN](https://github.com/jwyang/faster-rcnn.pytorch), as well as human pose estimation methods like [YOLOPose](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06806), [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose), and [VideoPose3D](https://github.com/facebookresearch/VideoPose3D).

Before pursuing my master’s studies, I had the privilege of working with Prof. [Chengguang Sun](https://dianzi.tute.edu.cn/info/1291/25242.htm), Prof. [Jianqiang Mei](https://dianzi.tute.edu.cn/info/1291/25232.htm), Prof. [Dan Cheng](https://dianzi.tute.edu.cn/info/1291/25162.htm), and Prof. [Xuewen Ding](https://dianzi.tute.edu.cn/info/1291/25172.htm)  on topics related to the Internet of Things, Embedded Systems, Image Processing, and Machine Learning. Under the supervision of Prof. Sun, I completed my undergraduate thesis “Design of Intelligent Greenhouse Garden Based on AIoT Technology”, which was awarded The Excellent Graduation Project (Thesis) in 2023. Later, under Prof. Mei’s supervision, I further strengthened my research and academic writing skills in deep learning and computer vision.

### 🔍 Current Research

I am currently conducting research on **Visual Anagrams and Optical Illusions** at the University of Edinburgh, under the supervision of Prof. Tsaftaris, Dr. Dimitrakopoulos, and Mr. Vilouras. My work investigates how **generative diffusion models** and **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** can be used to create **multi-view optical illusions** that explore the boundaries between **visual perception** and **machine generation**. This research focuses on understanding how generative models represent **ambiguous visual information**, and how content–style and content–content interactions influence the creation of perceptually coherent yet semantically distinct images. The ultimate goal is to provide insights into **human perception** and **AI interpretability** through the lens of generative modeling.

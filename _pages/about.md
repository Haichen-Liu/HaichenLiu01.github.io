I am currently pursuing my Master's degree in Signal Processing and Communications at the [School of Engineering](https://eng.ed.ac.uk/), [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). 

Originally from China, I completed my undergraduate studies majoring in Electronic Information Engineering, focusing on digital signal processing, image processing, human pose estimation, and embedded systems.

Throughout my academic and career journey, I have been dedicated to applying theoretical knowledge to solve practical problems, with a particular emphasis on enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of algorithms. Over the past few years, I have participated in multiple projects related to image processing, human pose estimation, and embedded systems. These experiences have not only honed my technical skills but also strengthened my capabilities in teamwork and project management.

By continuously learning and exploring, I have mastered various advanced technologies and tools, always maintaining a high sensitivity and enthusiasm for emerging technologies. Looking forward, I am full of anticipation to continue delving into digital signal processing and image processing while being eager to share my knowledge and experiences with more people who are passionate about these fields.
